# Assignment Project 1

My project is to make a responsive website for a fictional company site of my own. My fictional company is a camera store in central singapore selling mainly camera goods and accessories, along with providing cleaning and repair services for cameras too.
 
## Design Process

As photography is my hobby, I am deeply interested in all things cameras and thought to create this fictional camera website store. I wanted to design my website to cater to users of all types, while maintaining a design aspect that portrays quality and efficiency through the usage of different fonts, colours and website layout. I chose to use the EB Garamond font for my main texts for a classic and refined look, while using Poppins for the rest of my text for a more casual and easy to read look. For the colour scheme of my website, I decided after much trial and error to use blue, beige, white and grey for my main colours. I want customers to feel excited and a sense of assurance when browsing on our website store, confident that we only provide the best products and services.

## Testing

--- IN PROGRESS ** TEMPLATE USED FOR NOW ---

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.
